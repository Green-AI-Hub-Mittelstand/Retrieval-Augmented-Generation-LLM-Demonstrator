['The production and consumption of clothing causes enormous amounts of emissions worldwide and particularly in the EU. As clothing is essential, the EU, among others, is developing new guidelines on how the textile industry can be made more sustainable. Garments are to be made more durable and emit fewer microplastics. They should also be easier to recycle, thereby creating a circular economy. This affects all areas of value creation. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods can help to make garments more sustainable and avoid overproduction.innovative software solutions for the textile industry INTEX specialises in software solutions for the textile industry and supports almost all processes in the textile supply chain with its solutions. From ERP processes to supply chain, INTEX has over 30 years of experience and almost 400 customers. The Green-AI Hub pilot project with INTEX is making the textile industry more sustainable with the help of suitable AI solutions along the entire process chain. Challenge: Sustainability in the design processIn the future, textile manufacturers will have to place more emphasis on sustainability due to new EU legislation and growing consumer awareness. The industry is struggling with a poor image and is strongly characterised by changing trends. Currently, garments are often designed without sustainability in mind, and environmentally friendly and socially responsible business models are rare. However, if sustainability aspects such as durability, recyclability and the proportion of microplastics are already taken into account when designing clothing, resource savings can be achieved over the entire life cycle. To promote a sustainable design process, INTEX therefore relies on the expertise of the Green-AI Hub Mittelstand to implement appropriate AI solutions. Consideration of sustainability criteria in the design process through an AI-supported suggestion systemIn the pilot project, an AI-supported suggestion system is being used to make garments more sustainable in textile design. The system is trained on the basis of the materials used, processing steps and information on durability, return rates, etc. This system can then suggest material combinations that enable a high degree of recycling and longevity and thus have less impact on the environment. This requires a knowledge database with the relevant information. This data should first be determined manually (e.g. recycling-optimised material selection, material quality, etc.) and then automatically as soon as sufficient life cycle data is available. This will be followed by training of the suggestion system, which will be tested by two customers using INTEX software, and a second use case is also planned in the pilot project. This will involve designing an AI system for predicting stock levels in online shopping and shipping. It will allow more accurate predictions to be made regarding expected sales via the various sales channels. This should reduce overproduction and save transport routes.Resource savings through an AI-based suggestion system and an AI system for inventory forecastingThe AI-based suggestion system supports the selection of raw materials during the design process (development). This has positive effects on the use of raw materials and the entire value chain right through to the end of life, as materials are used that last longer and can be recycled more easily. This can change the existing processes of clothing manufacturers if they design their garments accordingly. The AI system for inventory forecasting starts with production planning, which results in resource savings in other parts of the value chain - especially in production and transport.Resource savings through AI-supported suggestion system for sustainability criteria in the design processThe pilot project of the Green-AI Hub Mittelstand enables resource savings through an extended service life of garments and improved recyclability. The AI solution is integrated into the existing INTEX software. This creates a multiplier effect across the industry. Even if the individual savings per item of clothing are only ten percent, several million tonnes of material could be saved each year if the solution is used on a broad scale. This would also have a far-reaching impact on CO2, water, chemicals and other resources in the areas of production, logistics and disposal. We therefore expect the solution to amortise very quickly and make a significant positive contribution to the environment.\n\nTechnology\nAI capability: Decision-making & knowledge representation and processing AI model: AI-supported recommender system\n\nValue creation\nPhase: Development & productionAim of AI: Resource-saving changes in the design process; inventory prediction\n\nResource efficiency\nMaterial savings: several tonnes of millions of textiles per year (multiplier effect)Reduction of microplastic emissions by saving synthetic materials\n\nThe company\nIndustry: Software solutions in the textile industryINTEX EDV-Software GmbH', 'The company SWMS creates software for the additive manufacturing of large components. Printing is carried out using an industrial robot to which a print effector is attached. During this printing process, however, there are always deviations, e.g. due to changes in the curing process or inaccuracies in the layer-by-layer application of the material. The aim of the project is therefore to continuously monitor the entire 3D printing process using sensor components (such as nozzle and thermal cameras) in order to detect printing errors at an early stage.Software solutions for 3D printing from OldenburgSWMS Systemtechnik Ingenieurgesellschaft mbH, founded in 1996, is a technology company for digital industrial solutions based in Oldenburg, Lower Saxony. With around 40 employees, the company offers software solutions in the complex field of automated composite manufacturing that support customers from the design of composite components through to their production. All activities are bundled in the CAESA software environment in corresponding modules and are available as system and manufacturer-independent programming and design software. Customers include companies from the aerospace, automotive, shipbuilding and wind power industries.Challenge: minimising printing errors through AI-supported monitoringA major challenge for the company is to continuously monitor the 3D printing process in order to stop the printing process if errors occur or, ideally, to maintain the print or component by taking countermeasures such as active cooling. As additive manufacturing must also be cost-effective for smaller batch sizes (up to batch size 1), the reliable production of components without major run-in measures is necessary and essential.When manufacturing composite components, flat components can be produced using traditional methods such as printing moulds. The stiffness of these components can be significantly increased by 3D printing support structures into this mould. However, if the 3D print fails, the entire component may be a reject, and currently quality control usually only takes place after the printing process has been completed. An ideal solution would be if a deviation could be detected and countermeasures initiated during the printing process. Simply recognising an error and stopping the printing process without taking countermeasures would also lead to material savings and an increase in resource efficiency.AI-supported object recognition and image segmentation as a solutionThis is precisely where artificial intelligence can come in. AI-supported object recognition or image segmentation can identify printing errors and initiate countermeasures. The AI used here learns image-based object recognition and segmentation using deep learning approaches, and the AI model must first be trained accordingly so that the potential of the AI can be fully utilised. To do this, data from the sensors, such as the nozzle and thermal camera, must first be recorded and labelled manually. Training with labelled data is then necessary before the detection performance can be determined in use. Once the training has been completed, live images from the camera can be monitored using the trained AI model, which can reduce or completely avoid errors in production over time.Added value through AI for companies and customersThe component developed in the pilot project for error detection in 3D printing is intended to become part of control software for non-planar 3D printing and is therefore an additional service component that is created for the customer. The component itself is used for continuous quality control of the production process. This results in several advantages, including for the customer and not for the company itself: firstly, the aim is to integrate the AI component into the existing control software for additive manufacturing so that the component becomes part of a complete solution. On the other hand, it should lead to a general improvement in the quality of additive 3D printing in the long term, as a broader basis can be created by continuously collecting sensor data in order to not only detect errors, but also to determine and exclude the causes of errors.saving resources by integrating AI-supported monitoring into customer systemsThe areas of service and production in the value chain are addressed in particular. SWMS Systemtechnik Ingenieurgesellschaft mbH is a technology company for digital industrial solutions and not a direct provider of 3D printing services, which means that the AI process will initially only have a minor impact (as part of testing and developing the pilot) on resource efficiency within the company. However, the integration of an error detection component into the control software for additive manufacturing will result in a multiplier effect, as the software can be used by many different companies, and the AI solution will have a significant impact on the consumption of the printing material, known as filament, as the objects to be printed will be continuously monitored for errors during the printing process and quality control will not only take place after the printing process has been completed, as was previously the case. It is estimated that this can save around a third of the material used in desktop 3D printing. In addition, resources for operating and controlling the robot arm, heating the filament and, if necessary, actively cooling the print material are saved, while the costs for the actual use of the AI solution are relatively low, as they are limited to the use of the trained AI model to analyse the visual data from the cameras, which can now be carried out using standard hardware. Higher costs are incurred when training the AI models, as the training cycles generally require higher-performance hardware or access to computing clusters. Costs are also incurred for the manual labelling of the data and the use of sensors, computers to store the data, licence fees for the system software and construction materials for the setup. How quickly the investment is amortised depends on several parameters, such as the print volume, the amount of filament used and also the tolerance range for deviations in the print.\n\nTechnology\nAI capability: object recognition and image segmentation AI model: computer vision\n\nAdded value\nPhase: Production & ServiceAim of AI: Error detection and avoidance in 3D printing of components\n\nResource efficiency\nGHG reduction potential of 2.53 tonnes of CO2eSavings in printing material (filament) and energy\n\nThe company\nIndustry: Software developmentSWMS Systemtechnik Ingenieurgesellschaft mbH Our pilot project at KÜBLER GmbH uses an AI-based system configurator to optimise the ...\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead more about the article: AI-based configuration of heating systems 4Packaging GmbH is a manufacturer of gravure cylinders.

Johann Herges GmbH, a third-generation shoe manufacturer, is striving to fundamentally transform the production of orthopaedic insoles through the use of artificial intelligence. The company plans to utilise an AI-supported 3D printing process for the production of orthopaedic insoles in order to increase resource efficiency. The pilot project will investigate which advanced machine learning models, such as artificial neural networks (ANN) and support vector machines (SVM), are best suited for this purpose.Innovative production of orthopaedic insoles in SaarbrückenJohann Herges GmbH is an advanced shoe manufacturer that produces a wide range of orthopaedic solutions. This includes customised shoes, customised orthopaedic shoes, compression stockings, bandages, orthoses and, above all, orthopaedic insoles, which address a wide range of clinical pictures. The orthopaedic insoles are manufactured using traditional methods based on footprints in foot foam. Various materials are glued and ground onto blanks for this purpose.challenge: replacing the subtractive production process Depending on the clinical picture, building insoles using blanks can be very time-consuming or even completely impossible. In around 30 per cent of cases, a subtractive process is therefore used, in which insoles are made from blocks of ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), a petroleum-based product. However, around 80 per cent of the material used in the milling process is lost as waste. An alternative solution is therefore 3D printing of insoles, which produces virtually no waste. Nevertheless, the extensive manual design process often stands in the way of an economical application.additive production process through AI-supported 3D printing3D printing opens up a sustainable alternative with lower material usage. A printable 3D model differs significantly from a model designed for conventional milling. With a 3D-printed model, infill structures must be used to create different stiffnesses within the insert. However, the manual construction of these filling structures is time-consuming. This is where AI comes into play by automating the process. Using pressure measurements, the AI analyses the foot and generates a 3D model with optimal filling structures. As part of the pilot project, the company plans to use advanced machine learning models such as artificial neural networks (ANN) and support vector machines (SVM). The aim is to explore which model is best suited for the application. A training dataset will be created to ensure that the unique expertise and know-how of the orthopaedic technicians is integrated into the automatically generated model. A powerful computer system may be required once for this. However, it should be possible to use it later in the daily workflow without any problems using a standard PC.Resource efficiency through AI-based production changeoverThe project addresses the production section of the value chain. The use of AI significantly simplifies the processes involved in the production of complex insoles. Numerous time-consuming manual steps are a thing of the past, as the construction of the insoles is now realised using 3D printing. The manual work is limited to recording the foot characteristics and making minor adjustments before 3D printing. Overall, this leads to a more efficient use of human labour, while the unique expertise and quality that sets the company apart is maintained in every insole produced through training with manually created data sets.the use of AI has a transformative effect on the company's resource efficiency. The switch from a subtractive to an additive manufacturing method results in a significant reduction in material consumption. Material savings of over 70 per cent have been recorded for plastics, particularly ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA). In addition, the 3D printing process is up to 60 per cent more energy efficient than milling. These developments suggest that a reduction in the use of materials will lead directly to a lower carbon footprint. Although the integration of AI initially requires investment in technology, training and integration, these costs are quickly amortised as significant savings in materials and energy are achieved.\n\nTechnology\nAI capability: generation of a 3D model AI model: regression, digital models, artificial neural networks (ANN) and support vector machines (SVM)\n\nValue creation\nPhase: ProductionAim of the AI: Additive production process through AI-supported 3D printing\n\nResource efficiency\nSavings on materials: over 70 per centSavings on energy: up to 60 per centTHG reduction potential of 0.63 t CO2e\n\nThe company\nIndustry: Manufacturing industry, shoe manufacture, orthopaedic shoe technologyHERGES Schuhmanufaktur Our pilot project at KÜBLER GmbH uses an AI-based system configurator to optimise the production ...\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead more about the article: AI-based configuration of heating systems 4Packaging GmbH is a manufacturer of gravure cylinders.

The production of these cylinders is an important process in the manufacture of packaging. The quality of the cylinders determines the appearance of the final packaging. Artificial intelligence is intended to help save materials and energy in the production process, determine the quality grade and perform visual quality control. To this end, additional sensors, known as retrofitting, will be attached to 4Packaging's machines and systems. In addition, existing sensor streams and other image data are analysed and merged for each application.Innovative production of gravure cylinders in the Teutoburg Forest4Packaging GmbH is a family business founded in 2000 and based in Dissen am Teutoburger Wald in Lower Saxony, near Osnabrück. Around 120 employees take care of processes that take place before the actual printing of packaging: Artwork and reproduction, packaging development in 3D as well as embossing and gravure form production.  Gravure form production in particular is characterised by the use of materials and energy and the guarantee of high quality. 4Packaging recycles the gravure cylinders used in gravure form production. This is comparable to a sheet of paper and a pencil, whereby the sheet of paper is always reused and new labelling is made possible by an eraser. In practice, this looks different: Chromium and copper are deposited and applied to the cylinder in the micrometre range. The copper layer is used to engrave the printed image. The chrome layer makes the cylinders more resistant so that the printing forme can be used for longer in the printing process. The application and removal process is energy-intensive; for example, chemical solutions are required in the galvanic process to apply the copper layer. Many small parameters, such as the machine settings and the condition of the gravure cylinders, can influence the quality of the gravure cylinders and therefore the print result. Technological change and new requirements from 4Packaging's customers require continuous adjustments to the processes, which 4Packaging always meets innovatively. 4Packaging was the first engraver in the world to install an automated production line and has continuously expanded and modernised it ever since. The digital development of packaging in 3D enables customers to realise their ideas digitally without having to spend resources on physical development. Challenge: Improving process quality in electroplating Ensuring reliable process quality is extremely important in the production of gravure cylinders. The smallest errors, e.g. during the so-called degreasing process, can lead to poor-quality gravure cylinders that are unusable downstream in the printing process. The quality of the gravure cylinder is also determined by the electroplating process. Electroplating is an electrochemical process for applying fine metal layers to a metallic or other conductive surface, e.g. copper and chrome. Various parameters determine the quality of the coating, e.g. the pH value, current density, bath temperature, duration or even the degree of contamination of the bath. The baths are currently monitored manually by sending samples of the chemical baths to the laboratory for analysis. In the pilot project, the Green-AI Hub Mittelstand is using additional sensors to monitor the chemical baths more continuously and recognise sources of interference at an early stage. This significantly improves the process quality in electroplating.Automation and optimisation of quality determination through artificial intelligence Artificial intelligence helps 4Packaging to better understand the influences of the various process parameters on quality and to continuously determine the quality of its products based on visual image and machine data. Artificial neural networks (ANN) are used to analyse the sensor data, which originates from the previous sensors of the machines and systems, but was supplemented by additional sensors installed in the chemical baths, so-called retrofitting, as part of the Green-AI Hub pilot project. The neural network is used to determine the quality of the gravure cylinder. The AI is supplemented by the use of computer vision (image processing), which automatically analyses images of the gravure cylinders for defects and classifies the type of defect. The use of both technologies, i.e. neural networks and computer vision, requires large amounts of data as well as so-called labels, i.e. the categories that are assigned to a data set. For example, the computer vision model requires not only the image data, but also a label indicating which defects are located where. The preparation of the data set for the computer vision model is initially a manual process, i.e. the labelling is carried out by a person. Once an initial computer vision model has been trained, this data preparation step can be automated by the existing model so that only a confirmation and any correction of incorrectly interpreted error detections is carried out. Saving resources through AI-based quality determinationThe AI-based quality determination at 4Packaging will automate manual quality checks so that deviations in the process are recognised earlier. By improving processes with the help of AI-based quality determination, 4Packaging expects to reduce defective gravure cylinders in the production process by 20 per cent in the medium term, which would be up to 403 cylinders per year, with potential savings in both the carbon footprint and the material footprint, which quantifies the life cycle-wide material expenditure. With the use of artificial neural networks (ANN) to analyse sensor data and the use of computer vision, the carbon footprint could be reduced by between 9-12 tonnes of CO₂ equivalents and the material footprint by 26-73 tonnes of CO₂ equivalents in relation to annual production.
